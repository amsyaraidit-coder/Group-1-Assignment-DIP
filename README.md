# Team Contribution
1. MUHAMMAD ASMYAR AIDIT :Lead Developer (NumPy/SciPy Logic), Code Optimization, README Documentation
Responsible for the technical implementation of the project. I developed the Python scripts that handle image matrix manipulation without relying on OpenCV. My primary focus was translating the color theory (RGB channels) into NumPy boolean logic and implementing the scipy.ndimage functions to clean up the masks."
   
2. NUR JANNAH HANIYYA : Image Data Collection, Testing & Parameter Tuning, Presentation Slides
Responsible for the experimental side of the project. Gathered the dataset of challenging images (camouflage/multi-color objects) and performed iterative testing. Adjusted the sensitivity of the color filters and the size of the morphological kernels to ensure the code worked across different test cases, also led the creation of the final presentation."
